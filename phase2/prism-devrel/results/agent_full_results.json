Please provide: 1) provider config (token/refresh endpoints, client auth method: client_secret_basic vs client_secret_post), 2) exact refresh request (URL, headers, body — redact secrets), 3) full 401 response body and server logs for the token endpoint, 4) SDK/library and version you’re using, runtime (server OS/node/python/etc.), and steps to reproduce (minimal curl or code). Troubleshooting tips to try meanwhile: confirm refresh_token is not expired/revoked, ensure client authentication method matches provider, send Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded and correct grant_type=refresh_token, and check server clock skew. If you share the request/response snippets and config, I’ll pinpoint the issue.",
