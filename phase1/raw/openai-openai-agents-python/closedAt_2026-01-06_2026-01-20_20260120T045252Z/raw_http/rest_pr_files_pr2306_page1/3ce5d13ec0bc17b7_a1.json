Use when asked to audit doc coverage, sync docs with code, or propose doc updates/structure changes. Only update English docs under docs/** and never touch translated docs under docs/ja, docs/ko, or docs/zh. Provide a report and ask for approval before editing docs.\n+---\n+\n+# Docs Sync\n+\n+## Overview\n+\n+Identify doc coverage gaps and inaccuracies by comparing main branch features and configuration options against the current docs structure, then propose targeted improvements.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+1. Confirm scope and base branch\n+   - Identify the current branch and default branch (usually `main`).\n+   - Prefer analyzing the current branch to keep work aligned with in-flight changes.\n+   - If the current branch is not `main`, analyze only the diff vs `main` to scope doc updates.\n+   - Avoid switching branches if it would disrupt local changes; use `git show main:<path>` or `git worktree add` when needed.\n+\n+2. Build a feature inventory from the selected scope\n+   - If on `main`: inventory the full surface area and review docs comprehensively.\n+   - If not on `main`: inventory only changes vs `main` (feature additions/changes/removals).\n+   - Focus on user-facing behavior: public exports, configuration options, environment variables, CLI commands, default values, and documented runtime behaviors.\n+   - Capture evidence for each item (file path + symbol/setting).\n+   - Use targeted search to find option types and feature flags (for example: `rg \"Settings\"`, `rg \"Config\"`, `rg \"os.environ\"`, `rg \"OPENAI_\"`).\n+   - When the topic involves OpenAI platform features, invoke `$openai-knowledge` to pull current details from the OpenAI Developer Docs MCP server instead of guessing, while treating the SDK source code as the source of truth when discrepancies appear.\n+\n+3. Doc-first pass: review existing pages\n+   - Walk each relevant page under `docs/` (excluding `docs/ja`, `docs/ko`, and `docs/zh`).\n+   - Identify missing mentions of important, supported options (opt-in flags, env vars), customization points, or new features from `src/agents/` and `examples/`.\n+   - Propose additions where users would reasonably expect to find them on that page.\n+\n+4. Code-first pass: map features to docs\n+   - Review the current docs information architecture under `docs/` and `mkdocs.yml`.\n+   - Determine the best page/section for each feature based on existing patterns and the API reference structure under `docs/ref`.\n+   - Identify features that lack any doc page or have a page but no corresponding content.\n+   - Note when a structural adjustment would improve discoverability.\n+   - When improving `docs/ref/*` pages, treat the corresponding docstrings/comments in `src/` as the source of truth. Prefer updating those code comments so regenerated reference docs stay correct, instead of hand-editing the generated pages.\n+\n+5. Detect gaps and inaccuracies\n+   - **Missing**: features/configs present in main but absent in docs.\n+   - **Incorrect/outdated**: names, defaults, or behaviors that diverge from main.\n+   - **Structural issues** (optional): pages overloaded, missing overviews, or mis-grouped topics.\n+\n+6. Produce a Docs Sync Report and ask for approval\n+   - Provide a clear report with evidence, suggested doc locations, and proposed edits.\n+   - Ask the user whether to proceed with doc updates.\n+\n+7. If approved, apply changes (English only)\n+   - Edit only English docs in `docs/**`.\n+   - Do **not** edit `docs/ja`, `docs/ko`, or `docs/zh`.\n+   - Keep changes aligned with the existing docs style and navigation.\n+   - Update `mkdocs.yml` when adding or renaming pages.\n+   - Build docs with `make build-docs` after edits to verify the docs site still builds.\n+\n+## Output format\n+\n+Use this template when reporting findings:\n+\n+Docs Sync Report\n+\n+- Doc-first findings\n+  - Page + missing content -> evidence + suggested insertion point\n+- Code-first gaps\n+  - Feature + evidence -> suggested doc page/section (or missing page)\n+- Incorrect or outdated docs\n+  - Doc file + issue + correct info + evidence\n+- Structural suggestions (optional)\n+  - Proposed change + rationale\n+- Proposed edits\n+  - Doc file -> concise change summary\n+- Questions for the user\n+\n+## References\n+\n+- `references/doc-coverage-checklist.md`",
