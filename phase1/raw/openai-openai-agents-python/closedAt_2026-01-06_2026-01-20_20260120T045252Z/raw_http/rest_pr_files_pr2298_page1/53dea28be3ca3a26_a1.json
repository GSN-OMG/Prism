Checklists are permitted only in the Progress section (and are mandatory there).\n+\n+## Guidelines\n+- Define jargon immediately and tie it to concrete files or commands in this repo.\n+- Anchor on outcomes: acceptance should be phrased as observable behavior; for internal changes, show tests or scenarios that demonstrate the effect.\n+- Specify repository context explicitly: full paths, functions, modules, working directory for commands, and environment assumptions.\n+- Be idempotent and safe: describe retries or rollbacks for risky steps; prefer additive, testable changes.\n+- Validation is required: state exact test commands and expected outputs; include concise evidence (logs, transcripts, diffs) as indented examples.\n+\n+## Milestones\n+- Tell a story (goal → work → result → proof) for each milestone; keep them narrative rather than bureaucratic.\n+- Each milestone must be independently verifiable and incrementally advance the overall goal.\n+- Milestones are distinct from Progress: milestones explain the plan; Progress tracks real-time execution.\n+\n+## Living Sections (must be present and maintained)\n+- Progress: checkbox list with timestamps; every pause should update what is done and what remains.\n+- Surprises & Discoveries: unexpected behaviors, performance notes, or bugs with brief evidence.\n+- Decision Log: each decision with rationale and date/author.\n+- Outcomes & Retrospective: what was achieved, remaining gaps, and lessons learned.\n+\n+## Prototyping and Parallel Paths\n+- Prototypes are encouraged to de-risk changes; keep them additive, clearly labeled, and validated.\n+- Parallel implementations are acceptable when reducing risk; describe how to validate each path and how to retire one safely.\n+\n+## ExecPlan Skeleton\n+\n+```md\n+# <Short, action-oriented description>\n+\n+This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must stay up to date as work proceeds.\n+\n+If PLANS.md is present in the repo, maintain this document in accordance with it and link back to it by path.\n+\n+## Purpose / Big Picture\n+Explain the user-visible behavior gained after this change and how to observe it.\n+\n+## Progress\n+- [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n+- [ ] Example incomplete step.\n+- [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n+\n+## Surprises & Discoveries\n+- Observation: …\n+  Evidence: …\n+\n+## Decision Log\n+- Decision: …\n+  Rationale: …\n+  Date/Author: …\n+\n+## Outcomes & Retrospective\n+Summarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned; compare to the original purpose.\n+\n+## Context and Orientation\n+Describe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name key files and modules by full path; define any non-obvious terms.\n+\n+## Plan of Work\n+Prose description of the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location and what to change.\n+\n+## Concrete Steps\n+Exact commands to run (with working directory). Include short expected outputs for comparison.\n+\n+## Validation and Acceptance\n+Behavioral acceptance criteria plus test commands and expected results.\n+\n+## Idempotence and Recovery\n+How to retry or roll back safely; ensure steps can be rerun without harm.\n+\n+## Artifacts and Notes\n+Concise transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples.\n+\n+## Interfaces and Dependencies\n+Prescribe libraries, modules, and function signatures that must exist at the end. Use stable names and paths.\n+```\n+\n+## Revising a Plan\n+- When the scope shifts, rewrite affected sections so the document remains coherent and self-contained.\n+- After significant edits, add a short note at the end explaining what changed and why.",
