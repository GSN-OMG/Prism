It guides you to fetch remote tags, pick the previous release tag, and thoroughly inspect the `BASE_TAG...TARGET` diff for breaking changes, introduced bugs/regressions, improvement opportunities, and release risks.\n+\n+## Quick start\n+\n+1. Ensure repository root: `pwd` → `path-to-workspace/openai-agents-python`.\n+2. Sync tags and pick base (default `v*`):\n+   ```bash\n+   BASE_TAG=\"$(.codex/skills/final-release-review/scripts/find_latest_release_tag.sh origin 'v*')\"\n+   ```\n+3. Choose target (default `main`, ensure fresh): `git fetch origin main --prune` then `TARGET=\"main\"`.\n+4. Snapshot scope:\n+   ```bash\n+   git diff --stat \"${BASE_TAG}\"...\"${TARGET}\"\n+   git diff --dirstat=files,0 \"${BASE_TAG}\"...\"${TARGET}\"\n+   git log --oneline --reverse \"${BASE_TAG}\"..\"${TARGET}\"\n+   git diff --name-status \"${BASE_TAG}\"...\"${TARGET}\"\n+   ```\n+5. Deep review using `references/review-checklist.md` to spot breaking changes, regressions, and improvement chances.\n+6. Capture findings and call the release gate: ship/block with conditions; propose focused tests for risky areas.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+- **Prepare**\n+  - Run the quick-start tag command to ensure you use the latest remote tag. If the tag pattern differs, override the pattern argument (e.g., `'*.*.*'`).\n+  - If the user specifies a base tag, prefer it but still fetch remote tags first.\n+  - Keep the working tree clean to avoid diff noise.\n+- **Map the diff**\n+  - Use `--stat`, `--dirstat`, and `--name-status` outputs to spot hot directories and file types.\n+  - For suspicious files, prefer `git diff --word-diff BASE...TARGET -- <path>`.\n+  - Note any deleted or newly added tests, config (for example `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `mkdocs.yml`), migrations, or scripts.\n+- **Analyze risk**\n+  - Walk through the categories in `references/review-checklist.md` (breaking changes, regression clues, improvement opportunities).\n+  - When you suspect a risk, cite the specific file/commit and explain the behavioral impact.\n+  - Suggest minimal, high-signal validation commands (targeted tests or linters) instead of generic reruns when time is tight.\n+- **Form a recommendation**\n+  - State BASE_TAG and TARGET explicitly.\n+  - Provide a concise diff summary (key directories/files and counts).\n+  - List: breaking-change candidates, probable regressions/bugs, improvement opportunities, missing release notes/migrations.\n+  - Recommend ship/block and the exact checks needed to unblock if blocking.\n+\n+## Resources\n+\n+- `scripts/find_latest_release_tag.sh`: Fetches remote tags and returns the newest tag matching a pattern (default `v*`).\n+- `references/review-checklist.md`: Detailed signals and commands for spotting breaking changes, regressions, and release polish gaps.",

It runs the coverage suite, analyzes results, highlights the biggest gaps, and prepares test additions while confirming with the user before changing code.\n+\n+## Quick Start\n+\n+1. From the repo root run `make coverage` to regenerate `.coverage` data and `coverage.xml`.\n+2. Collect artifacts: `.coverage` and `coverage.xml`, plus the console output from `coverage report -m` for drill-downs.\n+3. Summarize coverage: total percentages, lowest files, and uncovered lines/paths.\n+4. Draft test ideas per file: scenario, behavior under test, expected outcome, and likely coverage gain.\n+5. Ask the user for approval to implement the proposed tests; pause until they agree.\n+6. After approval, write the tests in `tests/`, rerun `make coverage`, and then run `$code-change-verification` before marking work complete.\n+\n+## Workflow Details\n+\n+- **Run coverage**: Execute `make coverage` at repo root. Avoid watch flags and keep prior coverage artifacts only if comparing trends.\n+- **Parse summaries efficiently**:\n+  - Prefer the console output from `coverage report -m` for file-level totals; fallback to `coverage.xml` for tooling or spreadsheets.\n+  - Use `uv run coverage html` to generate `htmlcov/index.html` if you need an interactive drill-down.\n+- **Prioritize targets**:\n+  - Public APIs or shared utilities in `src/agents/` before examples or docs.\n+  - Files with low statement coverage or newly added code at 0%.\n+  - Recent bug fixes or risky code paths (error handling, retries, timeouts, concurrency).\n+- **Design impactful tests**:\n+  - Hit uncovered paths: error cases, boundary inputs, optional flags, and cancellation/timeouts.\n+  - Cover combinational logic rather than trivial happy paths.\n+  - Place tests under `tests/` and avoid flaky async timing.\n+- **Coordinate with the user**: Present a numbered, concise list of proposed test additions and expected coverage gains. Ask explicitly before editing code or fixtures.\n+- **After implementation**: Rerun coverage, report the updated summary, and note any remaining low-coverage areas.\n+\n+## Notes\n+\n+- Keep any added comments or code in English.\n+- Do not create `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` unless needed later.\n+- If coverage artifacts are missing or stale, rerun `pnpm test:coverage` instead of guessing.",
